# <Book-Search-Engine>

## Description

My motivation was to create a fun app for book lovers.
I built this project so people who enjoying reading books can save their favorite books for easy access.
I solved the problem of users having to search through a huge database for a book they want to read.
I learned how to connect the front and back end and using react as the front end
